# Unit 3: Lightning, W&B and Kaggle

In this unit, you will be learning how to refactor your PyTorch code to use PyTorch Lightning, which removes unnecessary boilerplate, as well as learning to log models with Weights&Biases (W&B). Finally, you will send your first submission to Kaggle!


## Content

Watch the following content. We list some of the main concepts on each of the units; if you feel comfortable with them you can skip that lesson. If not, watch it and take the quizzes at the end of each sub-unit.

- [Deep Learning Fundamentals: Units 5](https://lightning.ai/courses/deep-learning-fundamentals/overview-organizing-your-code-with-pytorch-lightning/) (â‰ˆ 80 minutes)
  - 5.5 is optional, data modules are only relevant for multi-GPU training, which isn't covered in the course.
  - Videos 2 and 3 of 5.6 are optional, we will use [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) for logging, not TensorBoard or CSV files.
 
 ## Assignment
    
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook) and open the Unit 3 assignment Jupyter Notebook from your fork and follow the directions there.
