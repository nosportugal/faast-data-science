# Unit 6: Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional neural networks are commonly used for computer vision, but they can also be used for sequential datasets like natural language. In this unit you will apply a CNN to the same dataset we've been working for the past units.

 ## Assignment
1. Adapt your code from the previous units to use a CNN with an Embedding layer. This [chapter of Made with ML](https://madewithml.com/courses/foundations/embeddings/#model) and this [chapter of d2l](https://d2l.ai/chapter_natural-language-processing-applications/sentiment-analysis-cnn.html) are good references on how to do this, since they also apply CNNs to text data.
2. Push the changes to your repo and submit at least one new submission to Kaggle. CNNs should lead to slightly better results compared to the previous unit, altought not by a significant amount. This happens in part due the the size of the dataset, which bottlenecks the complexity of the models that we can train from scratch.
